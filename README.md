# API blender
API blender is the web service that helps you decide which API to use. We provide starred rating of APIs which are based on a variety of metrics. If you are not satisfied by just using a single API and need to chain multiple, then this is your place! We support chaining multiple Rakuten APIs. In the upcoming versions we are going to provide an option to produce backend code/server that can be applied directly on a device. Not only this, but we will also support flows, where you can alternate between APIs and even synchronize multiple APIs to reach your end goal! As for now you can create your small systems, but in the future you will be able to build complex systems with ease!
