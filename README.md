# API blender
**API blender** is the web service that helps you decide which API to use. We provide starred rating of APIs which are based on a variety of metrics. If you are not satisfied by just using a single API and need to **chain multiple**, then this is your place! 

### We support chaining multiple Rakuten APIs. 

In the upcoming versions we are going to provide an option to produce backend code/server that can be applied directly on a device. Not only this, but we will also support flows, where you can alternate between APIs and even synchronize multiple APIs to reach your end goal! As for now you can create your small systems, but in the future you will be able to build complex systems with ease!

### Impact and solved problems
This application was inspired by system-of-systems concept. It allows to use other systems as building blocks for newer and more complex systems. In this case, those systems are APIs. 
We allow our users to create and have a clear image of whatever is going on in the backend server they are building, by visualizing it. It can also be helpful for users, that are struggling with understanding how APIs work, and those who just want to play around to see what is a result of multi step manipulation on a certain input. It also helps developers avoid repetitive and tedious code-writing and saves time, since it is made to be more like a game and less like work.
### Technologies used
For now, it only uses front-end technologies, namely HTML, JS, CSS. It is a single page web application at the moment. We deployed it on Netlify for the demnstration. We are also using the Redom library, along with bootstrap and mdbootstrap along with other common libraries, like jquery etc.
### Future
In the future, there are multiple milestones: 
* Introduce the starred ranking system, and incorporate more APIs
* Add more design choices, like concurrent running APIs, multiple inputs, flows(decision trees)
* Add more features such as  conversion to multiple languages to create a backend route for the resulting API
* Automatic production of readme and documentation
* Improve UI
* Making features paid (for storing charts/cloud services/converting them to backend code/having many APIs/sync runs)
